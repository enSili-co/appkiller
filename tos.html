            <p>The app is provided to you "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted under applicable law, AppKiller, on its own behalf and on behalf of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory or otherwise, with respect to the app, including all implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing, course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the foregoing, AppKiller provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no representation of any kind that the app will meet your requirements, achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software, , systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or defects can or will be corrected.</p>
            <p>Without limiting the foregoing, neither AppKiller nor any AppKiller's provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied: (i) as to the operation or availability of the app, or the information, content, and materials or products included thereon; (ii) that the app will be uninterrupted or error-free; (iii) as to the accuracy, reliability, or currency of any information or content provided through the app; or (iv) that the app, its servers, the content, or e-mails sent from or on behalf of AppKiller are free of viruses, scripts, trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.</p>
            <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of or limitations on implied warranties or the limitations on the applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to you.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>Notwithstanding any damages that you might incur, the entire liability of AppKiller and any of its suppliers under any provision of this Agreement and your exclusive remedy for all of the foregoing shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you for the app.</p>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall AppKiller or its suppliers be liable for any special, incidental, indirect, or consequential damages whatsoever (including, but not limited to, damages for loss of profits, for loss of data or other information, for business interruption, for personal injury, for loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to the use of or inability to use the app, third-party software and/or third-party hardware used with the app, or otherwise in connection with any provision of this Agreement), even if AppKiller or any supplier has been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails of its essential purpose.</p>
            <p>Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to you.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.</p>
            <p>This Agreement, together with the Privacy Policy and any other legal notices published by AppKiller on the Services, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and AppKiller concerning the Services. If any provision of this Agreement is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of this Agreement, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and AppKiller's failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. YOU AND AppKiller AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE SERVICES MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.</p>

            <p>Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require performance of an obligation under this Agreement shall not effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>
            <p>o failure to exercise, and no delay in exercising, on the part of either party, any right or any power under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of that right or power. Nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right or power under this Agreement preclude further exercise of that or any other right granted herein. In the event of a conflict between this Agreement and any applicable purchase or other terms, the terms of this Agreement shall govern.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Amendments to this Agreement</h2>
            <p>AppKiller reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to modify or replace this Agreement at any time. If a revision is material we will provide at least 30 days' notice prior to any new terms taking effect. What constitutes a material change will be determined at our sole discretion.</p>
            <p>By continuing to access or use our app after any revisions become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised terms. If you do not agree to the new terms, you are no longer authorized to use AppKiller.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Entire Agreement</h2>
            <p>The Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between you and AppKiller regarding your use of the app and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous written or oral agreements between you and AppKiller.</p>
            <p>You may be subject to additional terms and conditions that apply when you use or purchase other AppKiller's  services, which AppKiller will provide to you at the time of such use or purchase.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Updates to Our Terms</h2>
            <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to these Terms so that they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for example, through our Service) before we make changes to these Terms and give you an opportunity to review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the updated Terms. If you do not want to agree to these or any updated Terms, you can delete your account.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The app and its entire contents, features and functionality (including but not limited to all information, software, text, displays, images, video and audio, and the design, selection and arrangement thereof), are owned by AppKiller, its licensors or other providers of such material and are protected by ES and international copyright, trademark, patent, trade secret and other intellectual property or proprietary rights laws. The material may not be copied, modified, reproduced, downloaded or distributed in any way, in whole or in part, without the express prior written permission of AppKiller, unless and except as is expressly provided in these Terms & Conditions. Any unauthorized use of the material is prohibited.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Agreement to Arbitrate</h2>
            <p>This section applies to any dispute EXCEPT IT DOESN’T INCLUDE A DISPUTE RELATING TO CLAIMS FOR INJUNCTIVE OR EQUITABLE RELIEF REGARDING THE ENFORCEMENT OR VALIDITY OF YOUR OR AppKiller's INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. The term “dispute” means any dispute, action, or other controversy between you and AppKiller concerning the Services or this agreement, whether in contract, warranty, tort, statute, regulation, ordinance, or any other legal or equitable basis. “Dispute” will be given the broadest possible meaning allowable under law.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Notice of Dispute</h2>
            <p>In the event of a dispute, you or AppKiller must give the other a Notice of Dispute, which is a written statement that sets forth the name, address, and contact information of the party giving it, the facts giving rise to the dispute, and the relief requested. You must send any Notice of Dispute via email to: <a href="/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection" class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="345d5a525b74515a475d585d1a575b1a">[email&#160;protected]</a> AppKiller will send any Notice of Dispute to you by mail to your address if we have it, or otherwise to your email address. You and AppKiller will attempt to resolve any dispute through informal negotiation within sixty (60) days from the date the Notice of Dispute is sent. After sixty (60) days, you or AppKiller may commence arbitration.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Binding Arbitration</h2>
            <p>If you and AppKiller don’t resolve any dispute by informal negotiation, any other effort to resolve the dispute will be conducted exclusively by binding arbitration as described in this section. You are giving up the right to litigate (or participate in as a party or class member) all disputes in court before a judge or jury. The dispute shall be settled by binding arbitration in accordance with the commercial arbitration rules of the American Arbitration Association. Either party may seek any interim or preliminary injunctive relief from any court of competent jurisdiction, as necessary to protect the party’s rights or property pending the completion of arbitration. Any and all legal, accounting, and other costs, fees, and expenses incurred by the prevailing party shall be borne by the non-prevailing party.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Submissions and Privacy</h2>
            <p>In the event that you submit or post any ideas, creative suggestions, designs, photographs, information, advertisements, data or proposals, including ideas for new or improved products, services, features, technologies or promotions, you expressly agree that such submissions will automatically be treated as non-confidential and non-proprietary and will become the sole property of AppKiller without any compensation or credit to you whatsoever. AppKiller and its affiliates shall have no obligations with respect to such submissions or posts and may use the ideas contained in such submissions or posts for any purposes in any medium in perpetuity, including, but not limited to, developing, manufacturing, and marketing products and services using such ideas.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Promotions</h2>
            <p>AppKiller may, from time to time, include contests, promotions, sweepstakes, or other activities (“Promotions”) that require you to submit material or information concerning yourself. Please note that all Promotions may be governed by separate rules that may contain certain eligibility requirements, such as restrictions as to age and geographic location. You are responsible to read all Promotions rules to determine whether or not you are eligible to participate. If you enter any Promotion, you agree to abide by and to comply with all Promotions Rules.</p>
            <p>Additional terms and conditions may apply to purchases of goods or services on or through the Services, which terms and conditions are made a part of this Agreement by this reference.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Typographical Errors</h2>
            <p>In the event a product and/or service is listed at an incorrect price or with incorrect information due to typographical error, we shall have the right to refuse or cancel any orders placed for the product and/or service listed at the incorrect price. We shall have the right to refuse or cancel any such order whether or not the order has been confirmed and your credit card charged. If your credit card has already been charged for the purchase and your order is canceled, we shall immediately issue a credit to your credit card account or other payment account in the amount of the charge.</p>
            
            <h2 style='font-weight:bold; color:black;'>Miscellaneous</h2>
            <p>If for any reason a court of competent jurisdiction finds any provision or portion of these Terms & Conditions to be unenforceable, the remainder of these Terms & Conditions will continue in full force and effect. Any waiver of any provision of these Terms & Conditions will be effective only if in writing and signed by an authorized representative of AppKiller. AppKiller will be entitled to injunctive or other equitable relief (without the obligations of posting any bond or surety) in the event of any breach or anticipatory breach by you. AppKiller operates and controls the AppKiller Service from its offices in ES. The Service is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation. Accordingly, those persons who choose to access the AppKiller Service from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable. These Terms & Conditions (which include and incorporate the AppKiller Privacy Policy) contains the entire understanding, and supersedes all prior understandings, between you and AppKiller concerning its subject matter, and cannot be changed or modified by you. The section headings used in this Agreement are for convenience only and will not be given any legal import.</p>
